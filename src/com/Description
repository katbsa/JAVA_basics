Program which:
- reads three integers (f.ex.: a, b, c),
- prints these three numbers,
- rearranges the values in these variables in such a way that a contains the smallest of the three numbers, b — the middle one, and c — the largest,
- finally prints them again in the same order.
It is possible that two (or all three) numbers are equal. Exercise should be solved without using arrays or Strings!
